                <p class="f5 f4-ns">Hi, I’m <a href="" class="link dim green">Velvet Spors</a>, a post-doctoral researcher at the <a href="" class="link dim green">Gamification Group</a> at <a href="" class="link dim green">Tampere University</a>.</p>
                <p class="f5 f4-ns">I am currently researching what we can learn from nature in games for the design of nature-centric technology in real-life. After all, games connect us, make us cry or laugh (or both at the same time!). They also allow us an open, safe space to explore feelings and make sense of ourselves.</p>
                <p class="f5 f4-ns b">I am looking to talk to people who enjoy playing games to explore what nature in games means for them: lush meadows, dense forests, vast deserts, or deep, mysterious oceans?</p>

                    <summary class="b">Could you give me a short overview of the project?</summary>
                    Sure thing! This project is investigating how people make sense of nature in games: What is meaningful to people? What is not? Which aspects make nature in games interesting or bothersome? How is nature being perceived in games?
                    To do so, I am looking for people to talk to, and show us a nature experience in a game, to make sense of it together. Based on these calls, interviews, and knowledge bits, I hope to figure out some branches for other folks to build upon – researchers, game designers and players alike, both in actual nature and in virtual spaces.
                    This project is a research study being conducted by a researcher based in Tampere University, Finland.

                    As with all research, there are a couple of risks involved:
                    <ul>
                        <li>People who know you well might identify you based on publications from this project, e.g., through quotes.</li>
                        <li>The setting of the research might lead to unpleasant experiences (e.g., talking aloud while playing might feel awkward).</li>
                        <li>Even though we try to make sure this does not happen: The research data might get accessed and/or stolen by someone who is unauthorised (examples: computers get stolen, the university server gets hacked).</li>
                    </ul>

                <details class="f5 f4-ns pa3 mv3 soft-trans">
                    <summary class="b">I have never used MURAL / a collaborative online space before.</summary>
                    No worries! If you decide to take part, you will be sent an introduction and videos that explain how everything works and how to interact with the space. All you need is a fairly stable internet connection and an up-to-date web browser (e.g., Firefox, Google Chrome ...).
                </details>

                <details class="f5 f4-ns pa3 mv3 soft-trans">
                    <summary class="b">I don’t think I could bring anything new to the video call.</summary>
                    I hear you 100%! The calls are not necessarily about making or creating anything new: They are more about what games mean to you personally, and what nature and the environments means within (game)play. By collecting a number of different people’s experiences, I am hoping to make (some) sense of the space, so that other researchers, designers and game developers can hopefully use it as inspiration.

                <p class="f5 f4-ns">Through my research, I am trying to figure out how gameful technology can support people to make meaning in, with and through nature – through encountering it and engaging with it from a number of different angles, in real-life.

                <p class="f5 f4-ns">Speaking more broadly, my research centres around care and technology in future-oriented ways: How do we want to live, and what part will technology play in our many possible futures? How can we take care of ourselves and others?</p>
